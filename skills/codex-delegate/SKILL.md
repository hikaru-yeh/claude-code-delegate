# Codex Delegate Skill

Claude is the supervisor. Codex CLI runs the mechanical work. Claude plans, constrains scope, reviews the diff, and verifies outcomes.

## Hard rules

- Before invoking the wrapper, run `codex --version` via Bash. If it fails, stop and tell the user to `npm install -g @openai/codex`.
- When calling `codex exec` directly (not through the wrapper), close stdin explicitly (`</dev/null`); the wrapper handles this internally.
- Wrapper run leaves machine-readable status at `<log-file>.result.json`. Acceptance is Claude's job, not the wrapper's.
- Do not wrap the wrapper in `Start-Process`. Call it inline so file writes persist.

## When to delegate

Mechanical → `codex` · Reasoning → `claude` · Long-context synthesis → `gemini`.

Full routing table and good/bad examples: `references/delegation-targets.md`.

## Workflow

1. **Brief**: write `.ai/codex_task_<name>.md` with Context / Goal / Constraints / Acceptance. Template: `references/task-template.md`. If the brief was already written by `agent-task-splitter` at `.ai/codex_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md`, read `.coord/plan.yml` for round context first.

2. **Run**: from Claude Code Bash, invoke the wrapper from its install location (user-scope skills install at `~/.claude/skills/`):
   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude/skills/codex-delegate/scripts/run_codex.sh \
     --prompt "Read .ai/codex_task_<name>.md and execute all instructions inside." \
     --repo "$PWD" \
     --log-file .ai/codex_log_<name>.txt
   ```
   `--repo "$PWD"` overrides the wrapper default so it operates on the current project. PowerShell variant + env vars: `references/wrapper.md`.

3. **Read status**: `cat .ai/codex_log_<name>.txt.result.json`.
   - `success` → diff still needs review.
   - `fallback` → Codex quota hit; Claude must take over.
   - `error` → wrapper failed; check `<log>.error`.

4. **Accept**: read the diff, confirm scope, run the verification commands listed in the task file. Reject if Codex drifted. Extended checklist: `references/review-checklist.md`.

## Output contract

`.result.json` includes at minimum: `status` (success|fallback|error), `delegate` ("codex"), `model`, `log_file`, `output_file`, `summary`, `risks`, `files_changed`, `tests_run`, `timestamp_utc`. Full schema and status semantics: `references/output-contract.md`.

## Compatibility

- Tested with `@openai/codex` 0.128.0 (May 2026). Should work with any version that accepts `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write`.
- Default model: `gpt-5.4` (override via `--model` or `-Model`). Other models on your CLI: see `codex models`.
- Wrapper calls `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write -C <repo> -m <model>`. The older `--full-auto` flag is deprecated in 0.128+ and was replaced.
- `codex exec` runs in non-interactive mode and auto-approves (no `--ask-for-approval` flag exists on `exec`; that flag is top-level only).
- Direct `codex exec` calls must close stdin (`</dev/null`) to avoid the historical hang (issue #20919).
- PowerShell wrapper requires `$ErrorActionPreference` to NOT be `Stop` so stderr writes (warnings, banners) don't trip the catch block.
